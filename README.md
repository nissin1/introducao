All the files in this repository are just study objects. The objective is to learn the basics of coding at my own pace, so don't expect to encounter well structured and/or fuctioning codes.
I'm not used to Git Hub yet, so I'm probably making a real mess with file organization, but I'll manage to do it better eventually.
Lastly, fell free to ask or help me with anything.
